# AssistMode
dump of celeste assist mode strats/sequences/timings/anything else I want. starting with any% levels.

I'm Hydrei, a Celeste runner. I've done a good deal of assist mode running in the past, and when I decided to come back to the gamemode, I figured I'd save as much info as I could in the process of relearning everything, in case anyone else actually wants to play these godforsaken categories. This is loosely inspired by buhbai's arbguide and koralreef's any% cue dump, but don't expect anything as polished or formatted as theirs. Due to the invincibility assist runners have and the dash-spamming nature of the gamemode, visual cues are a lot less necessary, so there won't be many pictures or gifs (also I don't know how to add them lol!). Discord is Hydrei#1364 if you have questions or suggestions.

Disclaimers:
When I say "the any% strat" or the like, I mean the non-assist mode strat.
Know the tech terminology, otherwise this will make very little sense. Standard terms for everything (no uphypers to be found). I call the empty bottom of a screen that you can bounce off of "void."

## Golden Ridge

### start

>In room 1, do an immediate hyper cb. Getting a good/bad cb doesn't matter for the next bit, but if you don't get a cb at all do three uprights -> right dash -> demohyper, which sets you up for the second half of the room as normal. After the cornerboost, do 3 upright dashes, then a wavedash, then three more upright dashes. This should line you up perfectly for a demohyper, then grounded ultra into the next room. [2.176]

>Literally just do the normal any% strat [2.856]

>3 wavedashes, upright, then do wavedash into immediate ultra. The timing for the ultra sequence is finicky and needs some getting used to. Upright -> second ultra sequence of the room after skipping the granny cutscene. This is basically the any% strat. [4.981]

>complicated, needs an image [2.567]

>Two ultras, spam a few more into void, then right dash, upright into bubble, take the bubble upright and wavedash into grounded ultra out. [3.264]

>Wait a bit, then upright three times. I do this with one jump button, because if the uprights are too fast you won't make it into position for the next action, which is a wavedash into a tight ultra. Try not to jump to early for the ultra, there's plenty of coyote time available and the crumble block has a tendency to cause cornerfucks. [2.618]

>Ultra in, jump off of the stone, wavedash off of the moving platform, then two uprights and a right dash -> demohyper or wavedash, depending on your positioning. [2.210]

>Wavedash in is important. Hold jump and cb, then almost instantly upright cb. You'll get a shitload of speed if both cboosts are good, so once you've cleared the second pillar downdash -> downright -> wavedash. If you don't get as much speed or are comfortable with the timing, you can downright early -> downdash -> downright -> wavedash instead, but this doesn't save time from my testing. [2.278]

>Archie room. Take the bubble upright, then do two uplefts and a left dash, and you'll hit both coins. Fastfall and take the bubble downright. Wavedash off of the key block as it descends and immediately upright cb, then wavedash again. This timing is tricky and requires some practice. [3.791]

>Grounded ultra if you can on the entry platform and wavedash off of the lowest cloud, then just spam uprights until getting to the bubble, and take the bubble up. Transition wallbounce doesn't save time, don't go for it. [2.924]

>Updash. [2.091]
