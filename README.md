# AssistMode
dump of celeste assist mode strats/sequences/timings/anything else I want. for now this is more of a database for myself than anything else but eventually it might become more of a "guide."

I'm Hydrei, a Celeste runner. I've done a good deal of assist mode running in the past, and when I decided to come back to the gamemode, I figured I'd save as much info as I could in the process of relearning everything, in case anyone else actually wants to play these godforsaken categories. This is loosely inspired by buhbai's arbguide and koralreef's any% cue dump, but don't expect anything as polished or formatted as theirs. Due to the invincibility assist runners have and the dash-spamming nature of the gamemode, visual cues are a lot less necessary, so there won't be many pictures or gifs (also I don't know how to add them lol!). Discord is Hydrei#1364 if you have questions or suggestions.

Disclaimers:
When I say "the any% strat" or the like, I mean the non-assist mode strat.
Know the tech terminology, otherwise this will make very little sense. Standard terms for everything (no uphypers to be found). I call the empty bottom of a screen that you can bounce off of "void."

11/12/20 city now
11/13/20 back to ridge now im laaaaazy and just gonna drop segment timings probably

## Forsaken City

### start

>Without menuing, do upright -> upright -> right dash -> demohyper -> upright -> updash. The room timing listed does the non-menu strat. In fullgame, do the any% beginning, but pause after the upright. Once you have your infinite dashes, do a demohyper off of the platform (you should be lined up), then upright -> right dash out. [1.343]

>Don't do anything for a tiny bit after transition to get some extra height, then upright -> two right dashes -> demohyper. Shortly after, do an upright diag demo, then spam updashes to exit. The diag demo isn't necessary and only saves frames if anything at all, but it makes it less likely that you'll get caught on the little bit of scaffolding right before the updashes. [2.618]

>Upright -> udiag demo (strongly encouraged) -> two uprights -> two right dashes -> diag demo -> updash. Simple. [2.414]

>Wavedash, then two uprights, then updash spam. [1.938]

>Two uprights, updash, right dash, two more uprights. [2.006]

>Upright, diag demo, three more uprights, a couple right dashes, then updash. Hitting the spring is okay. [2.890]

roomsob 13.209, segment 13.66

### crossing

>Two uprights, an updash, then a wavedash. Keep jump held; you need height to set up a demohyper into an ultra off of the higher portion of the spiked platform block thing. One ultra will do you fine, 2 dashes break even at best. [2.499]

>Slide off the wooden platform (don't jump, bottleneck is vertical), then do a quick downleft into downright to get around the spiked wooden platform. Wavedash off the floor, then three upright dashes. Wavedash/ultra however you can in the last bit of the room. [2.958]

>Grounded ultra, then upright dash at least eight times in a row. Make sure the first one is inbetween the tiny spiked nub and the leftmost zipper to put you in a good position for the rest. [2.550]

>Right dash (spam this with demo and normal dash keys if your control scheme allows) four times, two uprights, a right demo, and an updash. [2.397]

>Four uprights and two right dashes. It's possible and one frame faster with three uprights, but if you framegreed too much you will bonk on the ceiling and lose a lot of time. [2.040]

>Wavedash off of the starting platform, then the left spiked column, and do three upright dashes. Be careful not to upright too late - you can get stuck under the crumble block. You'll be set up to demohyper into the next room. [2.193]

>Ultra -> right dash -> wavedash -> upright -> spam updashes to exit. [2.227]

>Upright into wavedash, then upright, updash, wavedash again. If you can, make it a short wavedash and then bhop into immediate grounded ultra to save a frame in the next room. [2.312]

roomsob 19.176, segment 19.43

### chasm

>Wavedash, then five upright dashes as fast as possible. Diag demo for the last one can save a frame depending on your positioning. [1.972]

>Wavedash to the left, then do three quick updashes. You'll be positioned to do another wavedash to the left, then an ultra, but the ultra can't be inputted too soon or else you'll end up bonking into the scaffolding pillar. Diag demo upleft is safer than a normal upleft, but it doesn't save time unless it's done optimally, so it's not necessary. Updash spam to exit. [3.485]

>Easy and fast sequence. Upleft -> updash -> updash -> upleft -> upleft -> right dash -> wavedash -> demo left -> updashes into the screen transition. [2.975]

>Do the any% super, but immediately afterwards do a sequence of upright -> right dash -> downright -> demo right -> two updashes -> right dash spam to exit. [2.822]

>Three uprights, three updashes, two uplefts. [2.346]

>Any% strat (wavedash into upright cboost). [1.649]

roomsob 15.249, segment 15.572

### summary

Don't get bogged down in city. Like in regular any%, it's a small fraction of the total run time. That being said, because of its short length it's not terribly difficult to get consistent. Aim for a 49 IL pb (without menuing) and consistent lower 50s in runs (52, 53 etc).

got a 24.463 segment in prac

## Golden Ridge

### start

>In room 1, do an immediate hyper cb. Getting a good/bad cb doesn't matter for the next bit, but if you don't get a cb at all do three uprights -> right dash -> demohyper, which sets you up for the second half of the room as normal. After the cornerboost, do 3 upright dashes, then a wavedash, then three more upright dashes. This should line you up perfectly for a demohyper, then grounded ultra into the next room. [2.176]

>Literally just do the normal any% strat [2.856]

>3 wavedashes, upright, then do wavedash into immediate ultra. The timing for the ultra sequence is finicky and needs some getting used to. Upright -> second ultra sequence of the room after skipping the granny cutscene. This is basically the any% strat. [4.981]

>complicated, needs an image [2.567]

>Two ultras, spam a few more into void, then right dash, upright into bubble, take the bubble upright and wavedash into grounded ultra out. [3.264]

>Wait a bit, then upright three times. I do this with one jump button, because if the uprights are too fast you won't make it into position for the next action, which is a wavedash into a tight ultra. Try not to jump to early for the ultra, there's plenty of coyote time available and the crumble block has a tendency to cause cornerfucks. [2.618]

>Ultra in, jump off of the stone, wavedash off of the moving platform, then two uprights and a right dash -> demohyper or wavedash, depending on your positioning. [2.210]

>Wavedash in is important. Hold jump and cb, then almost instantly upright cb. You'll get a shitload of speed if both cboosts are good, so once you've cleared the second pillar downdash -> downright -> wavedash. If you don't get as much speed or are comfortable with the timing, you can downright early -> downdash -> downright -> wavedash instead, but this doesn't save time from my testing. [2.278]

>Archie room. Take the bubble upright, then do two uplefts and a left dash, and you'll hit both coins. Fastfall and take the bubble downright. Wavedash off of the key block as it descends and immediately upright cb, then wavedash again. This timing is tricky and requires some practice. [3.791]

>Grounded ultra if you can on the entry platform and wavedash off of the lowest cloud, then just spam uprights until getting to the bubble, and take the bubble up. Transition wallbounce doesn't save time, don't go for it. [2.924]

>Updash. [2.091]

### shrine

This whole section is spamming dashes except for the last room. Get a pattern that works for you and nail it down, and you physically cannot lose time.

> dash spam

>Should only take two uprights and maybe an updash.

>Oops! All updashes.

>One wavedash, then spam until you're out.

>Wavedash, demohyper like the normal any% strat. Grounded ultras once you're in place as you would for chad ultra, but instead just upright then updash to exit.
